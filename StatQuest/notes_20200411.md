- Four-Fold Cross Validation
- Leave one out cross validation
- Ten-Fold Cross Validation
- Confusion matrix
- Sensitivity and Specificity


Sensitivity:
true positives
/
true positives + false negatives


Specificity:
true negatives
/
true negatives + false positives

Sensitivity: how good the algo is to predict positive values
Specificity: how good the algo is to predict negative values

calc:
performance/sum of actual

- if algo is fitting training data well but not testing data then algo(squiggly line) is overfit
- bias: how well the algo performs on training set
- variance: how well the algo performs on testing set
- residula: distance of line to data point
